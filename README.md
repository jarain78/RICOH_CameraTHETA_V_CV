# No-Camera OpenCV
Sample application that shows OpenCV running on both a physical 
device RICOH THETA V and an Android Video Device.  You
can develop a plug-in on the emulator and then have it run
on a physical device camera with only minor modifications.

Based on original work by roohii_3 with
modifications by https://github.com/iamagod (kasper on theta360.guide)
